# Data-Cleaning_202401100400058
This is my data cleaning project with some EDA.

# Project Overview
In healthcare, accurate disease prediction is essential for effective treatment and patient care. However, raw patient data often contains missing, inconsistent, or noisy values, reducing the accuracy of predictive models.  
This project focuses on **cleaning and preprocessing healthcare data** to improve the quality of inputs used in disease prediction models.

# Data Cleaning Steps
1. Handling Missing Values    
2. Standardizing Categorical Data  
3. Ensuring Date Consistency 
4. Removing Duplicate Records 

# Technologies Used
